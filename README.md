## üìñ About   

This project (**Bikcraft**) was developed during the **HTML and CSS for beginners** course at **[Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/)**. During the course, the basic principles of **UI/UX Design** and **coding** were learned, putting all concepts into practice developing **from wireframe to design** and finally, **website code** from **Bikcraft** an e-bike company that has a conceptual layout that can be implemented anywhere today. We develop concepts such as **semantic HTML**, **optimization** of images and **CSS** files, **JavaScript** and yours functions, **Figma** to design with the style guide, wireframes and the final design of the website.
